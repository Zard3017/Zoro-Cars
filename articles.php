        <h5 class="card-title">The World’s Most Expensive Car Just Sold for an All-Time Record of $142 Million</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe exceeds the previous record price for a car by more than $95 million</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Read More</summary>
            <p class="card-text">In a secret auction at the brand’s museum in Germany, Mercedes-Benz sold one of just two 1955 300 SLR Uhlenhaut coupes from its extensive collection of historical automobiles—which dates back to the earliest days of the car in the late 19th century. The sale, to a private buyer,
                 was for 135 million euros ($142,769,250). It handily outstripped the previous record-setting $48.4-million sale of a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO at a 2018 auction to become the most expensive car ever sold at auction. Both of these high-dollar sales were brokered by RM Sotheby’s.

“Despite Ferrari being the most likely marque to have built a $100-million car, Mercedes-Benz was the next most likely candidate,” said Brian Rabold, the vice president of Hagerty Automotive Intelligence, the valuation wing of the classic car insurance, lifestyle, and editorial giant, Hagerty.
The two street-legal 300 SLR Uhlenhaut coupes were created by (and named for) Mercedes-Benz’s racing director at the time, Rudolf Uhlenhaut, who built them as part of a motorsport assault. Despite being among the fastest cars in the world at the time, they were never raced due to the brand’s withdrawal from racing in 1955 following a disastrous crash at the Le Mans endurance race that injured hundreds of spectators
 and killed over 80 people, including Mercedes’s driver.
 “This sale could push values of other apex cars like the Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic over the nine-figure mark,” Rabold said. “This most recent sale emphasizes how much the collector car market has matured over the past ten years, and that the best examples of these cars now rival the prices of some of the best pieces of art from the 20th century.”

The windfall from the deaccessioning of this shockingly valuable car will provide capital and endowment to fund a new altruistic endeavor from Mercedes-Benz. The so-called Mercedes-Benz Fund will be a not-for-profit entity controlled by the company, focused on providing educational scholarships for studies in sustainability, as well as science, technology, and engineering.

The buyer of the car, the first nine-figure purchase, has not been disclosed.

        <h5 class="card-title">How many millions of miles can a car last?</h5>
        <p class="card-text">A Mercedes-Benz 240D cab in service since 1988 has traveled 4.35 million miles.</p>
        <details>

            How long do you keep your car, and how far do you drive it? Well, lessees usually say three years and anything between 20,000 to 25,000 miles. For others, however, the vehicle has to last ten years or longer for cost reasons alone. And then there are the real mileage guzzlers with a million or more miles on the clock.

These are usually cabs, mostly from Mercedes-Benz, which is the case in a report from Grand Canary Island. According to Tenerife News, a W123 Mercedes 240D in the rather rare long version reached the milestone. The 17.6-foot-long saloon has been operating as a cab on the island since 1988. Up to seven passengers fit inside,
 plus the driver. The 72-horsepower diesel pairs with a five-speed manual gearbox.
 Behind the record-breaking Benz is a certain Domingo, who became known as "Dominguito" in Gran Canaria, Spain. According to Tenerife News, the long 240D is used in three shifts of eight hours each. That adds up to around 435 miles per day. The car has now clocked 4.35 million miles.
 <br>
 However, some parts are no longer original. According to the publication, with a mileage of 3,100 miles per week, the 240D requires up to 52 oil changes every year. In addition, there are fixed maintenance intervals. For example, the OM 616 engine is thoroughly checked every 621,371 miles. The current engine is only the second unit under the hood. A replacement one is already available if required.

Dominguito passed the cab and the company to his son. In 2008, one of the drivers came up with the idea of extensively restoring the 240D and making it the company's flagship. The new boss let him do it.

At that time, the car had a mileage of 2.4 million miles. The mileage has almost doubled since then. While the company made every effort to retain as many original parts as possible, they had to modernize the driver's seat and steering wheel. In addition, the passenger seats were reupholstered and covered.</p>

        <p class="card-text">The latest Mercedes-Benz C-Class is now subject to a nationwide product safety recall,
             with more 1400 examples of the mid-size luxury sedan hit with potential airbag woes.</p>

            <p class="card-text">
            At the same time, a handful of larger Mercedes-Benz CLS sedans have been recalled due to potential software-related safety issues.

In the first case, a total of 1465 examples of the fifth-generation (W206) 2023 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (model code 555) are being recalled due to concerns around the side airbag operation.
“Due to operation of the seat back rest, the driver and passenger side airbag wiring harnesses may become damaged over time caused by seat adjustment,” said Mercedes-Benz in its recall notice.
Mercedes-Benz says the deployment of the seat-mounted side airbags could therefore be impaired and, in the event of an accident, may not deploy as intended, which could increase the risk of injury or death to vehicle occupants.
It’s at least the fourth recall to hit the latest C-Class since its local release in 2022, following problems with fuse boxes in March 2024, fuel pumps in August 2023 and front passenger airbags in July 2023.

Separately, just three examples of the CLS-Class – all built in 2021 – are also being called back to the workshop due to a software issue with the airbag control unit, which could cause the pedestrian detection sensor not to function as intended.

“In the event of an accident, if the pedestrian detection pop-up bonnet feature does not operate as intended it could increase the risk of injury or death to pedestrians,” said Mercedes-benz in its recall notice.

Owners can check if their Mercedes-Benz C-Class or CLS vehicles are involved in the recalls.

        See How the Batmobile Was Tailor-Made for Ben Affleck</h5>
        <p class="card-text">For the new movie Justice League, Mercedes-Benz designers had to develop a full interior to be used by the new Bruce Wayne</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Read More</summary>
            <p class="card-text">
            The Batmobile has been an iconic vehicle ever since the popular series Batman first appeared in 1939. In his graphic, animated, and filmed decades in Gotham City, the Caped Crusader has been behind the wheel of a Cadillac, a Mercury, a modified Lincoln, and many invented others. In the new Warner Bros. movie Justice League, Batman’s alter ego, Bruce Wayne, drives a very special Mercedes-Benz, reflecting a new partnership that the German luxury brand has with the DC Comics franchise.

As Batman (Ben Affleck) heads out to recruit The Flash (Ezra Miller) to the superhero League, he gets into a stunning gull-winged, silver sports car and drives it off to his rendezvous. As it turns out, this was not as simple as handing the keys to a new E-Class convertible to Diana Prince, the alter ego of Wonder Woman ([Gal Gadot],(https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/oprah-winfreys-wonder-woman-party-got-gal-gadots-approval)) who also drives a Mercedes in the movie.
This is because this particular Batmobile was originally not a real car but just a virtual idea. The Vision Gran Turismo on which it is based was first unveiled in 2013 as one of a series of animated options designed specifically for the Sony PlayStation racing video game Gran Turismo 6. It proved so popular that a full-size physical scale model was shown later that fall at the 2013 Los Angeles Auto Show. But as a concept car, it was not at all functional. It was just a staid mockup.
In order to prepare the vehicle for use in the movie, Mercedes designers had to develop a full interior, including seats, lighting, and a computerized dashboard—all of which had to suit a high-status fictional character like Bruce Wayne. Moreover, in order to be sat in and used by Ben Affleck, who is nearly 6'4" tall, the low-slung, low-roofed concept had to be enlarged to 110 percent of its original scale. Maintaining line and proportion is very difficult in expanding a carefully crafted design like this, but it seems to have worked.
"As a designer you have to create fantasy, so we often get inspired by the film industry," says Gordon Wagener, the chief design officer for Mercedes’ parent company Daimler. "I am excited that this time, the film industry was inspired by us."
