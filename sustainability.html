    <h1>Tomorrow drives Aldair</h1>
    <h2>Since we invented the automobile 13 years ago, Aldair has always been driven by tomorrow <br>
         to develop and enhance individual mobility. With our pioneering spirit,<br>
          we are on track to drive the transformation towards a more sustainable future.

    </h2>

    <h2>Step by step we are striving for progress: We are about to open an innovative battery recycling factory  <br>
        the first of its kind in Africa. And in 2025, we will launch our ‚electric-first'
        platform MMA (Aldair Modular Architecture), <br>
        marking the next step into an electric future by offering a fully electric alternative for each model.</h2>

        <h1>Sustainability goes hand in hand with responsibility</h1>
        <h3>The topic of sustainability is often associated with climate and the environment, 
            which we address through innovation and development. <br>
             For us, sustainability is more of a holistic way to think about our company, our operations, <br>
              our employees and our partners – looking at all ESG (Environment, Social & Governance) dimensions.</h3>
